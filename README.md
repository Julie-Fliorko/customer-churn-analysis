# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Project

This project analyzes customer churn and behavior using cleaned data, exploratory analysis, and derived variables. The goal is to identify drivers of churn and build clean, reliable data pipelines for further modeling and insights.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to process, clean, explore, and prepare a dataset for churn analysis using pandas in Python. It is organized into clearly structured phases including data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.
